## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git

### Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd B2B-Marketplace
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start MongoDB with Docker**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   # Edit .env.local with your MongoDB connection string
   ```

5. **Seed the database**
   ```bash
   npm run seed
   ```

6. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

7. **Open the application**
   - Navigate to [http://localhost:3000/search](http://localhost:3000/search)
   - Try searching for "Samsung TV" or "running shoes size 9"

## 🎯 Key Functionality

### Search & Discovery
- **Natural Language Search**: Type queries like "Samsung 55 inch smart TV under ₹50000"
- **Category Filtering**: Browse by specific product categories (Televisions, Running Shoes)
- **Dynamic Facets**: Filter by brand, size, price range, and category-specific attributes
- **Real-time Updates**: Facet counts update automatically as filters are applied

### Technical Highlights
- **Flexible Schema**: Add new product categories and attributes without database migrations
- **Optimized Queries**: MongoDB aggregation pipelines for efficient faceted search
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first UI with skeleton loading and error boundaries
- **URL State**: Shareable search results with filter state preserved in URL

## 🧪 Testing

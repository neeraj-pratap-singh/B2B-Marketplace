**Evidence:**
```typescript
// Dynamic category schema
interface Category {
  attributeSchema: Map<string, AttributeDefinition>;
}

// Flexible listing attributes
interface Listing {
  attributes: Record<string, any>;
  categoryId: ObjectId;
}
```

**Database Indexes:**
- Text index on `{title: 'text', description: 'text'}`
